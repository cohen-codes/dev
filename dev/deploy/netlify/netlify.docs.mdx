This Netlify deployer deploys frontend app components to [Netlify hosting](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Basic usage

Fork this demo app which uses Netlify for deployment, and follow along the instructions:

```bash
bit fork teambit.cloud-providers/deployments/netlify my-app
```

Add your new app to the `workspace.jsonc` file:

```bash
bit use my-app
```

Head over to your app's [`netlify.ts`](https://bit.cloud/teambit/cloud-providers/deployments/netlify/~code/netlify.ts) file to configure your Netlify deployer:

```ts
const netlifyConfig: NetlifyOptions = {
  team: 'my-teams-slug',
  accessToken: process.env.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN as string,
  productionSiteName: 'my-wonderful-site',
};
```

Tag your app component to deploy it:

```bash
bit tag my-app --message "deploying my app"
```

## Compatibility with Netlify Options

This deployer allows you to use Netlify configuration files such as `netlify.toml` and `__redirects` files. You can read more about Netlify configuration files [here](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/).

If any of this configuration files are present in your app component, they will be deployed to Netlify.

## Default redirects for SPA apps

If `useDefaultRedirectsForSPA` is set to `true`, the deployer will add a `__redirects` file to your app component, which will redirect all requests to the `index.html` file.

```ts
const netlifyConfig: NetlifyOptions = {
  team: 'my-teams-slug',
  accessToken: process.env.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN as string,
  productionSiteName: 'my-wonderful-site',
  useDefaultRedirectsForSPA: true,
};
```

:::caution
This option will override any `__redirects` file you have in your app component.

## Staging and production environments

`stagingSiteName` is another optional prop, which specifies the name of the staging site. It is useful whenever you collaborate with other developers on the same application component.
We usually [snap](https://bit.dev/docs/components/snaps) components instead of tagging them when collaborating. Netlify deployer detects when the app component is snapped and deploys it to the staging site.

If the `stagingSiteName` prop is not provided, the deployer will deploy the app to a sitename created using the hash of the component ID or the lane ID.

```ts
const netlifyConfig: NetlifyOptions = {
  team: 'my-teams-slug',
  accessToken: process.env.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN as string,
  productionSiteName: 'my-wonderful-site',
  stagingSiteName: 'my-wonderful-site-staging',
};
```

Visit the site you have set and view your newly deployed app. For example: [https://my-awesome-site-0321456.netlify.app/](https://my-awesome-site-0321456.netlify.app/).

## Skipping deployment

You can skip deployment by setting the `skipDeployment` prop to `true`:

```ts
const netlifyConfig: NetlifyOptions = {
  team: 'my-teams-slug',
  accessToken: process.env.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN as string,
  productionSiteName: 'my-wonderful-site',
  skipDeployment: true,
};
```

In some cases you only want to skip the deployments when working on a lane, in this case you can use the `skipLaneDeployments` prop:

```ts
const netlifyConfig: NetlifyOptions = {
  team: 'my-teams-slug',
  accessToken: process.env.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN as string,
  productionSiteName: 'my-wonderful-site',
  skipLaneDeployments: true,
};
```

## Setting the netlify deployer on an existing app

1. Inside your app directory, initiate a Netlify deployer with your own Netlify config. See example [here](https://bit.cloud/teambit/cloud-providers/deployments/netlify/~code/netlify.ts).

2. In your app's [plugin file](#), set your app's deploy property with the `deploy` method of your Netlify instance. See example [here](https://bit.cloud/teambit/cloud-providers/deployments/netlify/~code/react-app.react-app.ts).

## Compatibility

This Netlify deployer deploys static frontend applications. It requires the [app's deployment context](/to-do) ([`DeployContext`](https://bit.dev/teambit/harmony/application/~code/app-deploy-context.ts)) to be extended to include the `publicDir: string` property (which points to the build output directory).
Apps that do not provide that, are not compatible.
